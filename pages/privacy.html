        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is handled in the MyPrescription mobile application (the "App").</p>
        
        <h3>Our Data Philosophy: Your Device, Your Data</h3>
        <p>MyPrescription is designed as an offline-first application. While you provide personal information to the app for it to function, we want to be crystal clear:</p>
        <p><strong>The App does not transmit your personal data to us or any third party.</strong> The information you enter is for your use only and includes:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Your name, age, or gender</li>
            <li>Your prescriptions or medical history</li>
            <li>Your doctor's information</li>
            <li>Any images or files you upload</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Local Data Storage</h3>
        <p>All data you enter into the App is stored exclusively in a private, secure area on your own device. It is never transmitted to us. This means we cannot see, access, or recover your data.</p>

        <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
        <p><strong>Google Sign-In:</strong> We use Google Sign-In as our sole method of authentication. When you sign in, you are providing your login credentials directly to Google. We only receive basic account information, such as your email address and display name, to identify your account, and this is also stored only on your device. We do not receive or store your password. Your use of Google Sign-in is governed by Google's Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h3>Data Deletion and User Rights</h3>
        <p>You have complete control over your data. You can add, edit, and delete any information at any time within the app. When you choose to delete your account from the 'Settings' screen, the following actions are performed:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li><strong>On-Device Data:</strong> All application data, including your family members' details, prescriptions, and reports, will be permanently deleted from your device's internal storage.</li>
            <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> Your authentication account with Google will be deleted.</li>
            <li><strong>Backup Files:</strong> Any backup files created using the app's backup feature are stored in your device's shared storage (e.g., the Downloads folder). The app does not have the permission to automatically delete these files. You are responsible for manually deleting any backup files you have created if you wish to remove them completely.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Handling of Children's Information</h3>
        <p>This App is not directed to children under the age of 13, and the app itself does not knowingly collect or transmit any data. A parent or guardian may choose to enter information about their child into the app for management purposes. In such cases, the parent or guardian is solely responsible for this data, which remains stored only on their device. The user can edit or delete this information at any time.</p>
